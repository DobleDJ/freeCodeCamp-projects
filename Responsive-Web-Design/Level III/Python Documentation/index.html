          Python was invented in the late 1980s by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> at
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_%26_Informatica">Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica</a> (CWI) in the

          system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced
          his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "<a

            >benevolent dictator for life</a
          >", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core
          developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#cite_note-45">[5]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode
          support. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the
          <code>2to3</code> utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python
          3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17,
          the final 3.7.x release). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e.
          "2.7.18+" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "backported security updates".
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7) because of security issues leading to possible
          remote code execution and web-cache poisoning. In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was
          released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future. On 7 September 2022,
          four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11
          from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of
          typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching
          statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other
          changes. Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.

        <!--Design philosophy and features-->
        <header>
          <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional
          programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract
          and logic programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late
          binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions; list
          comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (<code>itertools</code> and <code>functools</code>) that implement
          functional tools borrowed from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> and Standard ML.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its core philosophy is summarized in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">Zen of Python</a> (PEP 20), which
          includes aphorisms such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
          <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
          <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
          <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
          <li>Readability counts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, Python features regularly violate these principles and received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen
          of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life
          following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it
          particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and
          easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is
          more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it." philosophy. In practice, however, Python provides
          many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli">Alex Martelli</a>, a Fellow at the
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation">Python Software Foundation</a> and Python book author, wrote:
          "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer
          marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as
          C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be
          expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli">Monty Python</a> and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and
          reference materials, such as the use of the terms "spam" and "eggs" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used "foo" and "bar". A
          common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. "Pythonic" code may use Python idioms well, be natural
          or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough
          transcription from another programming language is called <em>unpythonic</em>.

          The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> of the Python programming language is the
          set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). The Python language has many
          similarities to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>,
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, and
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. However, there are some definite differences
          between the languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, and boasts a dynamic
          type system and automatic memory management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's syntax is simple and consistent, adhering to the principle that "There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it." The language incorporates
          built-in data types and structures, control flow mechanisms, first-class functions, and modules for better
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">code</a> reusability and organization. Python also uses English keywords where
          other languages use punctuation, contributing to its uncluttered visual layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language provides robust error handling through exceptions, and includes a
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a> in the standard library for efficient problem-solving. Python's
          syntax, designed for readability and ease of use, makes it a popular choice among beginners and professionals alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike
          many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and
          special cases than C or Pascal.

        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in
          indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed
          the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.

            The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is
            redefined
          </li>
          <li>
            The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should
            apply
          </li>
          <li>The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines</li>
          <li>The return statement, used to return a value from a function</li>
          <li>The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In
          Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in
          contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.

          Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[95][96] However, better support for
          coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[97] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the
          generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[98]

          <h2>Expresions</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Python's expressions include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two
            types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation. Python uses the +
            operator for string concatenation.
          </li>
          <li>Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.</li>
          <li>The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
          <li>The syntax :=, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</li>
          <li>
            In Python, == compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a
            <= b <= c.
          </li>
          <li>Python uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.</li>
          <li>Python has a type of expression named a list comprehension, and a more general expression named a generator expression.</li>
          <li>Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.</li>
          <li>Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y[103] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).</li>
          <li>
            Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must
            be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable.
            The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus,
            given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to
            t—thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous
            contexts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated
            in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals—and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects
            an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it
            assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python has a "string format" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in C—e.g. "spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2".
            In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. "spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2). Python 3.6 added "f-strings": spam =
            "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strings in Python can be concatenated by "adding" them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. "spam" + "eggs" returns "spameggs". If strings
            contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. "2" + "2" returns "22".
          </li>
          <li>
            Python has various string literals:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Delimited by single or double quotes; unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quotes work the same. Both use the backslash (\)
                as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".
              </li>
              <li>
                Triple-quoted (beginning and ending with three single or double quotes), which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.
              </li>
              <li>
                Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes
                are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare "@-quoting" in C#.)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are
            relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter called step or stride, allows
            elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating
          some functionality. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>List comprehensions vs. for-loops</li>
          <li>Conditional expressions vs. if blocks</li>
          <li>The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case
          is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C
          error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ...} is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code, but if c
          = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.

        <p>
          Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for
          Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other
          object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby). Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and
          ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations
          and type conversion.

        <p>
          Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail,
          signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example,
          adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling
          the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and
          reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): old-style and new-style, current Python versions only support the semantics new style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Mypy also
          supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.

        <header>
          <h2>Arithmetic operators</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4
          % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, and a matrix‑multiplication operator @ .[117] These operators work like in traditional
          math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (+ and - can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).
        </p>
        <p>The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.</li>
          <li>
            The floor division // operator was introduced. So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module used
            in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see above).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Python terms, / is true division (or simply division), and // is floor division. / before version 3.0 is classic division.</p>
        <p>
          Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always
          true. It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means
          that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce
          2.[120] Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is −1.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c
          tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c.[122] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b,
          resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a
          pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.[124] The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific
          scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.

          includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g. they can be implemented with C11 or C++.[133][134]) It compiles Python
          programs into an intermediate bytecode[135] which is then executed by its virtual machine.[136] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture
          of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7
          and 8;[137][138] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental
          installer) and unofficial support for e.g. VMS.[139] Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.[140] (During Python 1 and 2 development, even OS/2 and
          Solaris were supported,[141] but support has since been dropped for many platforms.) <br />
          Python, since 3.7, only supports operating systems with multi-threading support.

          Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting
          community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.[171] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[172] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by
          the Python community and the steering council.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's
          development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to
          GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.

        <p>CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:</p>
        <p>
          Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases
          happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen.[176] Major or "feature"
          releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9,
          these releases are expected to happen annually.[177][178] Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.[179] Bugfix releases,[180]
          which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security
          vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[180] Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also
          released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's
          development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.

        <p>The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.</p>
        <p>Python 3.12 removed wstr meaning Python extensions need to be modified, and 3.10 added pattern matching to the language.</p>
        <p>
          Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more will be dropped in the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array 'u' format code will emit
          DeprecationWarning since 3.13 and will be removed in Python 3.16. The 'w' format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is also deprecated and
          http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler will emit a DeprecationWarning, and will be removed in 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and
          functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a typing.NamedTuple class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such (and more)
          will be disallowed in Python 3.15.

          Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g. via mod_wsgi for the Apache webserver.[202] With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has
          evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the
          design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data
          mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,[203][204] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and
          Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects
          of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.[205] OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for
          computer vision and image processing.[206]
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, scikit-learn and the
          Logic language ProbLog.[207][208][209][210][211] As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used
          for natural language processing.[212]
        </p>

          The combination of Python and Prolog has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capablities.
          The Janus system, in particular, exploits the similarites between these two languages, in part because of their use of dynamic typing, and the simple recursive nature of
          their data structures. Typical applications of this combination include natural language processing, visual query answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling of
          semantic web data.[213][214] The Natlog system, implemented in Python, uses Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) as prompt generators for text-to-text generators like GPT3 and
          text-to-image generators like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.[215]
        </p>
        <p>Python can also be used for graphical user interface (GUI) by using libraries like Tkinter.[216][217]</p>
        <p>
          Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric
          modelers like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor
          Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[218] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[219] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python
          as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[220] It has also been used
          in several video games,[221][222] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.[223]
        </p>
        <p>
          Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions,[224] AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD,
          and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity
          installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.
        </p>
        <p>Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.[225][226]</p>
        <p>
          Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs as of 2008, is written in Python.[227] The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project
          has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.
        </p>
        <p>LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature[228] since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.</p>
