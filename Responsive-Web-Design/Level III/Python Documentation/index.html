          Python was invented in the late 1980s by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> at
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_%26_Informatica">Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica</a> (CWI) in the

          system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced
          his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "<a

            >benevolent dictator for life</a
          >", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core
          developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#cite_note-45">[5]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode
          support. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the
          <code>2to3</code> utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python
          3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17,
          the final 3.7.x release). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e.
          "2.7.18+" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "backported security updates".
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7) because of security issues leading to possible
          remote code execution and web-cache poisoning. In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was
          released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future. On 7 September 2022,
          four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11
          from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of
          typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching
          statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other
          changes. Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.

        <!--Design philosophy and features-->
        <header>
          <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional
          programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract
          and logic programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late
          binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> functions; list
          comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (<code>itertools</code> and <code>functools</code>) that implement
          functional tools borrowed from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> and Standard ML.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its core philosophy is summarized in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">Zen of Python</a> (PEP 20), which
          includes aphorisms such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
          <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
          <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
          <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
          <li>Readability counts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, Python features regularly violate these principles and received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen
          of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life
          following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it
          particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and
          easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is
          more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it." philosophy. In practice, however, Python provides
          many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli">Alex Martelli</a>, a Fellow at the
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation">Python Software Foundation</a> and Python book author, wrote:
          "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer
          marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as
          C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be
          expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli">Monty Python</a> and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and
          reference materials, such as the use of the terms "spam" and "eggs" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used "foo" and "bar". A
          common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. "Pythonic" code may use Python idioms well, be natural
          or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough
          transcription from another programming language is called <em>unpythonic</em>.

          The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> of the Python programming language is the
          set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (by both the runtime system and by human readers). The Python language has many
          similarities to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>,
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, and
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>. However, there are some definite differences
          between the languages. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented programming, and functional programming, and boasts a dynamic
          type system and automatic memory management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python's syntax is simple and consistent, adhering to the principle that "There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it." The language incorporates
          built-in data types and structures, control flow mechanisms, first-class functions, and modules for better
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code">code</a> reusability and organization. Python also uses English keywords where
          other languages use punctuation, contributing to its uncluttered visual layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language provides robust error handling through exceptions, and includes a
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a> in the standard library for efficient problem-solving. Python's
          syntax, designed for readability and ease of use, makes it a popular choice among beginners and professionals alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike
          many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and
          special cases than C or Pascal.

        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in
          indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed
          the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.

          A recursive function named foo, which is passed a single parameter, x, and if the parameter is 0 will call a different function named bar and otherwise will call baz,

            The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is
            redefined
          </li>
          <li>
            The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should
            apply
          </li>
          <li>The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines</li>
          <li>The return statement, used to return a value from a function</li>
          <li>The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program</li>
        </ul>

          The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In
          Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in
          contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.

          Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.[95][96] However, better support for
          coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[97] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the
          generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.[98]
